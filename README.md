First talk about process

- Lectures are recorded - Here is where you can find lecture code
- Here is how to clone down the repo
- Lecture priorities:

  - Interactivity is key
  - More questions the better
  - Try not to code along with lecturers. Taking notes is a good thing but if you try and copy the code we write, as you are copying it you will get lost as the lecture continues forward.

- Developing your own coding process. You are all (mostly) brand new to this. Everyone develops their own way of approaching and solving a problem. Coding is no different - over the course of the next 15 weeks you will all develop your own methodologies for tackling challenges.

- Debugging Techniques:

  - Pry
  - Puts

- Things that helped me:
  - Timestamp methods
  - Quiver
  - VSCode cool things
  - Spectacle
  - CMD +

Second talk about actual hashketball

- Talk about hashketball a little bit.
  - Ask students to identify data types
- Different data types
  - how to check data types
  - calling '.methods' on anything in ruby
  - Data types matter. I.E. adding a number to an array
- IRB walkaround
  - make an array and play with it
  - block return value vs. the methods return value
    - each vs. map
  - find/select
    - build an array of objects
    ```
    people = [{name: "Matt", age: 36},{name: "Alice", age: 25},{name: "Dave", age: 6},{name: "Nancy", age: 36}]
    ```
    - demonstrate select vs. find (first match vs. all matches)
- Walk through the lab and solve each of the tests systematically
- Test driven development

- Create a helper method first to grab all players
  ```
  def get_players
    players = []
    game_hash.values.each do |team|
      team[:players].each do |player|
        players << player
      end
    end
    players
  end
  ```
- num_points_scorded
  ```
  def num_points_scored(name)
    players = get_players()
    target_player = players.find do |player|
      player[:player_name] == name
    end
    return target_player[:points]
  end
  ```
- shoe_size
  ```
  def shoe_size(name)
    target_player = get_players.find {|player| player[:player_name] == name}
    return target_player[:shoe]
  end
  ```
- team_colors
  ```
  def team_colors(team)
    target_team = game_hash.values.find {|data| data[:team_name] == team}
    return target_team[:colors]
  end
  ```
- team_names
  ```
  def team_names
    teams = []
    game_hash.values.each do |team|
      teams << team[:team_name]
    end
    teams
  end
  ```
- player_numbers
  ```
  def player_numbers(team)
    jersey_numbers = []
    game_hash.values.each do |data|
      if data[:team_name] == team
        data[:players].each do |player|
          jersey_numbers << player[:number]
        end
      end
    end
    jersey_numbers
  end
  ```
- player_stats
  ```
  def player_stats(player)
    target_player = ""
    get_players.each do |person|
      if person[:player_name] == player
        target_player = person
      end
    end
    target_player.delete(:player_name)
    target_player
  end
  ```
- big_shoe_rebounds
  ```
  def big_shoe_rebounds
    biggest_shoe = 0
    rebounds = 0
    get_players.each do |player|
      if player[:shoe] > biggest_shoe
        biggest_shoe = player[:shoe]
        rebounds = player[:rebounds]
      end
    end
    rebounds
  end
  ```
